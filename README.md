#### Comparing-Classifiers-for-Building-Classification-Models
we will be comparing the performance of different classifiers for building classification models for Breast Cancer Dataset.

# Algorithm:
1. Make breast cancer dataset
2. Data split (80/20 ratio)
3. Build Classification Models
4. Build Model, Apply Model on Test Data & Record Accuracy Scores
5. Analysis of Model Performance

## Make breast cancer dataset:
Make the dataset by importing from sklearn and make classification of features and class label from sklearn.datasets

## Data split (80/20 ratio):
Split the dataset into Training set and Test set, where 80% of the dataset is assigned to Training set and 20% is assigned to Test set.

## Build Classification Models:

# Classifiers used:
- Nearest Neighbors
- Linear SVM
- Polynomial SVM
- RBF_SVM
- Gaussian Process Classifier
- GradientBoosting Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- ExtraTrees Classifier
- RandomForest Classifier
- Multi-layer Perceptron C lassifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
- SGDClassifier
